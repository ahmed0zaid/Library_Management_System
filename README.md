# Library Management System – Qt/QML + C++

This is a simple library management system I made for my Object-Oriented Programming course.  
The idea was to build a small application with a graphical interface where users can sign up, log in, browse books by genre, and book (rent) them. The interface is written in QML, and the logic behind it is in C++.

The goal of the project is mainly educational. I used it to practice OOP, file handling, and connecting C++ classes with QML.
